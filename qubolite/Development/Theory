Input posiform \phi
a) Network:
1. Find max flow in G_\phi:
- find symmetric max flow:
-- find max flow and symmetrize
- then the residual network will be symmetric too
2. Calculate residual network G_\psi:
- calculate G_\psi from G_\phi. See bottom page 7 for formula
(I) apply proposition 5 (page 10):
-- calculate S from G_\psi
-- calc J from S
-- calc assignments y from J and S
-- y is a strong autarky and hence x_i=y_i strong persistencies
(II) apply proposition 7 (page 11ff):
-- seciton 3.3.2 says remove negative capacities (how can there be any?)
section 5 - NETWORK says to remove all arcs associated to the set of strong persistencies
i think this are supposed to be all arcs connected to a node that has a strong persistency of x_i = y_i
this might be because 3.3.3 Decomposition demands this but i am suprised that we can already remove some here and do not have to wait for prop 7
-- calculate strong connected components
-- separate them into type (14) and (15)
-- use prop 7 for type (15), yields strong and weak persistencies
--- how to find K_1 is K_1 and not K_1'?
-- remove all arcs associated with strong and weak persistencies
(III) apply proposition 8 (page 13f):
- left are a disjoint set of strong components
- find them by calculating the strong components

b) HEURISTIC:
- look for in [31] online

c) COORDINATION:
?????

d) PROBING:
TODO
apply proposition 9
proposition 3 to recover original graph
